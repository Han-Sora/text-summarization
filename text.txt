Instagram is a free social network that allows users to share photos and videos, follow celebrities and friends, and send messages. Other Instagram users can see your photos and comment on them. Instagram is owned by Facebook. After creating an account, Instagram allows your kids to follow friends, celebrities or anyone they want. This is a photo social network, so your child can only share pictures/videos. Instagram also has a variety of filters and image editing tools to make your child's posts look more eye-catching and engaging. Teens who use Instagram as a way to express themselves with songs, artwork, poetry, and videos that showcase their talents tend to have a positive experience with the app. By balancing your child's use of Instagram with other activities (not just scrolling through the newsfeed), your child can build a useful network of friends and build a positive self-image. However, Life is not rosy, if not used intelligently and correctly, your child will be negatively impacted, affecting his cognitive, material and spiritual development.
